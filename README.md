# AbDesing_for_enzymes
Scripts and data to run AbDesign as described in Tools for protein science 2020. Below I'll describe the different steps, data needed and example command lines to genearte a repertoire of structures for the GH10 xylanase family. Steps 2-4 are using pdbID: 4pud as an example, but should be repeated for each of the structures of the chosen protein family.
To run the following, you are required to install:
  * python >3.5 
  * Rosetta (free for academic users)
  * pymol 

## 1 Structures and Segmentation scheme
The list of xylanase structures was taken from [here](http://www.cazy.org/GH10_structure.html) and downloaded from the PDB.  All structures must be aligned to the template structure, which can be done using the **alignto** command in PyMOL.

## 2 Backbone fragments databases
### 2.1 Initial crude fragment extraction
The segmentation points in this step are (numbering corrspond to template structure pdbID: 3w24):
| Segment | start | end |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1 | 19 | 47 |
| 2-4 | 44 | 189 |
| 5-6 | 183 | 256 |
| 7-8 | 246 | 324 |

The following command is used to extract a fragment structure corresponding to the fragment starting with *start_res* and ends with *end_res* in the *source* structure (i.e. the template). This command should be used for each protein in the family for each of the segments.  
For example, extracting the first fragment from structure 4pud.pdb would use the following command:
```bash 
ROSETTA_SCRIPTS @backbone_database/flags_cod -s data/4pud.pdb -out:prefix blade1_ -out:path:pdb pdbs -out:path:score scores  -parser:protocol backbone_database/cut_out_domain.xml -parser:script_vars source=data/3w24_template.pdb.gz start_res=19 end_res=47 
```
The output pdb of the ragment will be located at: pdbs/blade1_4pud.pdb.gz (you need to create the pdbs folder before running the command).  
### 2.2 Refinmenet of fragment alignment to template
In this step, fragments from the same segment are refined according to the template sructure to all have the exact same ends of the fragment to better assemble later (details in the paper).
In this step the template's fragments start & end at the following positions: (in different systems, make sure the fragments do not overlap)
| Segment | start | end |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1 | 19 | 45 |
| 2-4 | 46 | 186 |
| 5-6 | 187 | 249 |
| 7-8 | 250 | 320 |

In the command below, the fragment from step 2.1 is being matched to the fragment 1 from the template
```bash 
pymol -c ./backbone_database/find_best_match.py data/blade1_template.pdb data/blade1_4pud.pdb.gz
```
The resulting pdb file will be located at *pdbs/fbm_blade1_4pud.pdb*.
## 3 PSSM
First you need to genearte a PSSM for each of the structures of your protein family. We used PSSM generated by PROSS 9details in paper).  
The following command extracts a sub-PSSM, matching a fragment of the protein:
```bash
./pssm/cut_pssm_for_fragment.py data/fbm_blade1_4pud.pdb data/4pud.pssm
```
The output pssm is *fbm_blade1_4pud.pssm*.  
## 4 Torsion database
First we need to create to the following directories to hold the output: 
```mkdir pdbs scores  db```
The following command should be applied to each of the refined structuers from step 2.2. example on the 4pud structure:
```bach
ROSETTA_SCRIPTS @torsions_database/flags -out:prefix 4pudA_ -out:path:pdb pdbs -out:path:score scores -parser:script_vars source=data/fbm_blade1_4pud.pdb db=db/blade1_4pudA.db
```
